Date: April 2, 2023.

THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF USE APPLY IN ADDITION TO STANDARD XEN NETWORK TERMS OF USE (<a href="https://xen.network/terms">https://xen.network/terms</a>) WITH REGARDS TO XEN KNIGHTS CONTEXT.

WARNING: Advanced/experimental technology! Users are strongly encouraged to do their own research before proceeding.

<h2>Welcome to XEN Knights!</h2>
XEN Knights are bitcoin blockchain ordinals (also known as digital artifacts) with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The XEN Knights are for entertainment purposes only.

XEN Knights allows you to access and interact with certain portions of information stored in decentralized transactional databases (aka ‘blockchains’) accessible via ABI (Application Binary Interface), and colloquially referred to as ‘smart contracts’.

XEN Knights is a decentralized application (DApp) that doesn’t require registration, doesn’t create user accounts or store user information.

XEN Knights DApp uses 3-rd party applications known as Wallets or Crypto-Wallets (e.g. MetaMask, etc.) to sign requests to smart contract(s) (‘transactions’) and send them to respective blockchain(s).
Sending transactions to blockchains requires users to pay network usage fees (aka ‘gas’). Amount of required gas depends on a specific function of a smart contract. Gas price, nominated in blockchain network’s native coin (e.g. ether for Ethereum, etc.) is constantly changing depending on the current load of the network; the difference between lowest and highest gas prices could be several orders of magnitude.

WARNING: Users are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with the concept of gas and the gas pricing before proceeding.
